# Earthquake_Challenge


## Background

  Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.


## Challenge

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Create a layer of the Earth's tectonic plates on your map using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data. Be sure to use static/js/PB2002_boundaries.JSON for API. Start by using starter code for Tectonic Plate Data.

Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

  Create a layer of major earthquakes on your map using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data. Be sure to use links given in Challenge for API address and token.    Start by using starter code for Major Earthquake Data.

Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map Layer

  Choose any of the options using the MapBox Styles link as a third layer for your map. Be sure to have it work using all other layers of the map.
  
  After completing Deliverables 1 and 2, adding a dark mode for the map would be a helpful addition. This would allow a user to use it in darker settings and to       help reduce vision irritation. As seen from image below.
